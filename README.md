# Atlantic Examples

This repository contains example cairo programs to use with Atlantic.
It also has example contracts for using the verified execution on-chain.

## Cairo Programs

Developing and then proving your program with Atlantic.

- [cairo0 Rust VM](cairo0-rust-vm/README.md)

- [cairo1 Rust VM](cairo1-rust-vm/README.md)

- [cairo0 Python VM](cairo0-python-vm/README.md)

## Contracts

Asking Atlantic to verify your proof on-chain.

> **Note:** You have to first develop and send your program to Atlantic, as shown in the [examples above](#cairo-programs).

- [L1 Verification - Ethereum Contracts](l1-verification/README.md)

- [L2 Verification - Starknet Contracts](l2-verification/README.md)

## Offchain

Using the proof from Atlantic offchain, by yourself.

> **Note:** You have to first develop and send your program to Atlantic, as shown in the [examples above](#cairo-programs).

- [Offchain](offchain/README.md)
